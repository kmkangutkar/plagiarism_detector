As time passes by, it lets leak out newer methods, ideas and innovations. Robotic concepts have been traced back to about the 4th century, and today’s concepts have evolved even further, starting from tiny  nanobots that could make their way into one’s blood stream, and moving onto giant robotic arms.
Microrobotics has also been a major trend in today’s world. As we keep exploring as to how small circuits can actually get, it gives us a greater ability to focus on creating smaller microrobots. The purpose of this paper is to give an outline about the current advancements that have taken place specifically in microrobotics, and cover a variety of fields, including medical applications, insect behavior, microfabrication, micro assembly, positioning and also the microscale challenges that are faced with the fabrication and controlling of microrobots like the energy requirements and locomotion methods. Since the advancements in today’s generation of microrobotics is very rapid, such that a massive amount of ideas have been conceived in a matter of a decade, only a small number of recent ones have been chosen to be a part of this journal.
